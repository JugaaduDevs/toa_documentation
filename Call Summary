Things discussed -

1. Delivery - 
      a. Fine with phased approach and ready for 1.5 months for phase 1 . If not possible we can skip release into app/play store for this phase.
      b. concern is the other company that is working on the app has not delivered anything yet and since they are doing it for free he hasn't asked them to stop yet.
          As per him we might deliver faster than them but since he has bigger plans he might skip thier app even if they deliver . More will be discussed on call.
2. Cost - 
      a. He has asked us to give an estimate .
      b. He is also expecting us to support later .
      c. We can bill him per order and he is fine with it .
3. Future Plans
      a. He wants us to revamp his current site.
      b. Wants to be able to use the app for in restaurant ordering as well (This I had in mind already)
      c. Wants to replace the Point Of Sale System in the restaurant to be completly digital and have same look and feel as the app . Moving away from the obselete VB bases system.
      d. Might help us get more clients .
